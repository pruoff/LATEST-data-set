# LATEST: Occupant-Thermal-Comfort-Data-Set

This module provides the data set collected in a case study for validating the LATEST 
system described in [LATEST](https://github.com/pruoff/LATEST).

### File Descriptions
* `raw_data_from_influxdb_to_csv.ipynb` was applied to create the main data sets. It 
imports `setup.py`, which uses the files in `series/`.
The only cleaning that takes place is time step fitting and 
interchanging manual fixes due technical circumstances, such as sensor exchanges. Also, 
long periods in which no participant was at their workstation were removed.

* `data_collection_phase.csv` and `temperature_control_phase.csv` contain the main data 
sets. The former is used for training models which were deployed for collecting the 
latter.
 
* `latest.names` contains a description of the data sets and their features.

* `preprocessed_data/U#_preprocessed_data.csv` contains the fully preprocessed data 
per occupant, which was used for training the models for the temperature control phase. 

* `conda_env.yml` shows the conda environment used for the project.
